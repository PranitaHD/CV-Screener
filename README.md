# CV-Screener
Language :- HTML &amp; JavaScript with Bootstrap. Here the information of a candidate containing his/her Image, Name, Age, Location, Programming Language and Framework will be displayed one after the other. The "Next" button here helps to jump on the next candidate. The images of the Candidate's are purposely taken random from randomuser.me. I have used Visual Studio Code here.
